#  * Scenario: Modeling a Library System
#    You are tasked with designing a simplified digital library system.
#    * a. Identify at least three distinct classes you would create (e.g., Book, Member, Librarian).
#    * b. For each identified class, list at least three key attributes it would need and at least two important methods it would perform.
#    * c. Briefly explain how these classes would interact with each other (e.g., how would a Member borrow a Book?).
